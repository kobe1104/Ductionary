      "definition": "A horrendous company that has somehow managed to stay afloat for years and appeal to a mass of misguided people.  They specialize in taking existing technology, making it all shiny and fancy looking, and re-selling it for double the price.  Ironically, their slogan is \"Think Different\".\r\n\r\nTheir latest and greatest gadget that's getting all the attention is, of course, the iPhone, which is basically comparable to any high-quality $150 phone, except it has \"innovative\" touch screen technology, and it sells for $600.\r\n\r\nApple couldn't quite figure out how to make an operating system, so they just stole the freeBSD kernel and repackaged a bastardized version of it as Mac OS X.  It's funny that Apple brags that it's \"Unix-based\", since no one with experience in Unix would ever use a Mac.\r\n\r\nApple frequently runs \"clever\" ads.  Although they've made a ton of them, all the ads boil down to how Windows has viruses and crashes all the time.  Apple also have an enormous, cult-like fanbase that like to remind us of these things every five seconds.  Apple fanboys are generally smug, annoying, and arrogant, despite the fact that most of them don't know jack shit about computers.",
